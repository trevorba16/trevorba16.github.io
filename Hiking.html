			<h3>The Experience</h3>
			<p>
				Your experience hiking all depends on the trail. For inexperienced hikers, there are shorter trails, with easy terrain. For those who are more experienced, some trails require much more.	
			</p>
			<p>
				When planning a trip hiking, you want to make sure that you pick a time that isn't too hot, or a trail that has shade. You need a length that you can achieve comfortably, and you want a great view or experience once you get to the end.
