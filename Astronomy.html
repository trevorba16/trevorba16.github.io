			<h3>The Experience</h3>
			<p>
				Drive as far away from the city as possible, and set up somewhere with a clear view of the night sky.	
			</p>
			<p>
				This requires some advance planning, as the weather will greatly affect the experience, and you should also have a plan for what you hope to see before you get there. Do the research and learn when to go, how to set up, and where to look.
